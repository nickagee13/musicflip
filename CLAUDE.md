# MusicFlip Development Context

This file helps Claude Code remember the project state between sessions.

## Project Overview
Universal music link converter (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, etc.) built with React 19, TypeScript, and Vite 7.

**App Purpose**: Makes it effortless to share music across different streaming platforms. Instead of the frustrating "I don't use that service" dead-end, MusicFlip converts any song or album link into a universal version that works for everyone, letting friends enjoy music together no matter which app they use.

## Development Role & Workflow

**My Role**: Acting as a mobile product strategist, UX/UI designer, and full-stack developer to help conceptualize, design, and code MusicFlip.

### Development Workflow Progress
1. Brainstorm basic app ideas âœ…
2. Create a Vite project, then Build the basic UI only âœ…
3. Set up repo on GitHub, open code in VS Code to be tweaked with Claude Code âœ…
4. Create data structure and backend with Supabase âœ…
5. Connect UI with backend âœ…
6. Deploy working MVP âœ…
7. **UI polish (current step)** ðŸŽ¯

### Development Guidelines
- **Always think from three perspectives:**
  - **Strategist** â†’ Clarify product features, roadmap, and trade-offs
  - **Designer** â†’ Suggest clear UI/UX flows and layouts
  - **Developer** â†’ Write clean, commented code with explanations
- **Explain reasoning step by step** when proposing solutions
- **Suggest better implementations** before writing code if they exist
- **Assume beginner level** - teach concepts as we go, not just provide code

## Current Development Status
- **Last Updated**: 2025-09-01
- **Active Branch**: main
- **Build Status**: âœ… Clean (no pending changes)

## Key Commands
```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server (localhost:5173)
npm run build    # Production build with TypeScript compilation
npm run lint     # ESLint code quality check
npm run preview  # Preview production build
```

## Architecture Notes
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite 7
- **API**: SongLink/Odesli for music platform conversion
- **Styling**: CSS with CSS Variables for theming
- **Deployment**: Netlify with serverless functions

## Current Features
- Universal link conversion between music platforms
- Smart platform detection with visual indicators
- Web Share integration
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Responsive design
- Clipboard integration
- Error handling

## Development Context
- Recent focus: Code restructuring and documentation
- Clean codebase with no pending issues
- Professional folder organization implemented
- Animation fixes for UI components completed

## Future Development Roadmap

### ðŸš¨ High Priority - Native Integration
- **Share Sheet Registration**: User can share directly from any music app through native iOS/Android share menu
- **URL Scheme Handling**: MusicFlip opens automatically when user taps universal music links

### ðŸ“‹ Eventually Add Functionality
- **Copy/Paste Sharing Playlists**: Full playlist conversion between platforms

### ðŸ§ª Ideas to Experiment With

#### Phase 3: Loading & State Transitions (Medium Impact)
- Enhanced music bars with beat-synchronized pulsing
- Card morphing transitions between input â†’ loading â†’ results states  
- Results unfold animation from loading state
- Smooth reset transitions with reverse animations

#### Phase 4: Settings Panel Polish (Medium Impact)
- Smooth slide-in panel with backdrop blur effects
- Toggle switch animations with spring physics
- Theme transition effects across entire interface
- Settings icon rotation on panel open/close

#### Phase 5: Micro-Interactions & Polish
- Button state communications across all interactive elements
- Spatial continuity through shared element transitions
- Natural movement patterns following iOS/Material Design principles
- Accessibility considerations for reduced motion
